## 📘 About This Repository
This repository documents my self-learning progress in **cybersecurity**.  
I use platforms like **TryHackMe**, labs, and online materials to build real practical skills.

I learn independently at home and working as SOC Analyst T1 (had also practise as SOC coordinator and quality specialist) — and this repo is proof of my commitment, consistency, and growing experience.
